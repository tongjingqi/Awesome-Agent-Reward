## Introduction

**What is Reward Construction?**

Reward construction is the process of designing and collecting reward signals that guide AI agents toward desired behaviors and outcomes. 

**Why is Reward Construction Important?**

**Background: The Second Half & Era of Experience**

**[The Second Half](https://ysymyth.github.io/The-Second-Half/)**: Transitioning from creating new methods and models to defining new tasks
- **First Half Focus**: Exam-like tasks with universal methods (next token prediction, RL) and architectures (Transformer, GPT)
- **Turning Point**: Organic combination of universal methods and architectures, where RL on large models achieves generalization
- **Second Half Focus**: Project-based scenarios with multi-turn interactions and temporal learning

**[Era of Experience](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Era-of-Experience%20/The%20Era%20of%20Experience%20Paper.pdf)**: Large Models + Reinforcement Learning = General Superhuman Agents
- **Previous Era**: Human Data Era with limitations of human-generated data and capabilities
- **Current Opportunity**: Combining self-discovery capabilities with task generality from the human data era
- **Key Components**: Environmental rewards, autonomous interaction, continuous experience streams, non-human planning and reasoning

In conclusion, reward construction provides **interactive environments** and **learning signals**. It becomes crucial for AI agent to **get experience for new project**. 
We divided Reward Construction research into 5 categories, including **Synthesizing Verifiable Task**, **Real-World Task Reward Construction**, **Unsupervised Reward Construction**, **Reward Model** and **Evaluation and Benchmarks**.

## Limitation and Future Work

- Game data isn't utilized thoroughly. Games are shown effective to enhance model's general abilities, but open-source models rarely include games as training data.
- Using World Model to construct rewards. World models are capable of generating an endless variety of action-controllable, playable 3D environments for training and evaluating embodied agents.
- Evaluating interactable environments. A method to evaluate interactable environments, find high quality ones and choose environments fitting policy model's ability level would boost training a lot.
